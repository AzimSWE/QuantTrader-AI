Getting Started

## **What Does QuantTrader Do?**

QuantTrader fetches stock market data, applies a trading strategy, and logs trades. By default, it uses a mean-reversion strategy, but you can replace it with your own. It supports:
- Fetching stock data using APIs (like Alpaca).
- Executing trades automatically.
- Logging trades into a structured CSV file for analysis.
- Optional performance visualization with graphs.

---

## **How to Get Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Download the project to your computer:
```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantTrader.git
```

### **2. Install Python Libraries**
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required libraries:
```plaintext
pip install pandas matplotlib alpaca-trade-api
```

### **3. Run the Bot**
Navigate to the `src/` folder and open `main.py` in your Python editor. Run the script, and you’ll see the bot analyzing data and making trades:
```plaintext
BUY 1 shares of AAPL at $150
SELL 1 shares of AAPL at $155
```

## **Example: How QuantTrader Works**

1. **Market Analysis**: Fetch stock data and process it.
2. **Trading Decisions**: Use strategies to decide whether to buy or sell.
3. **Logging**: Save trade details to a CSV file for analysis.

Here’s an example trade log:
| Timestamp           | Symbol | Signal | Price |
|---------------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 2023-01-01 10:00:00 | AAPL   | BUY    | 150   |
| 2023-01-02 14:00:00 | AAPL   | SELL   | 155   |

## **How to Customize QuantTrader**

### **Adjust Trading Settings**
- Change the stock symbol and quantity in `main.py`:
  ```python
  SYMBOL = "AAPL"  # Replace with your desired stock symbol.
  QUANTITY = 1     # Adjust the number of shares to trade.
  ```

### **Add Your API Key**
- Open `data_fetcher.py` and add your API credentials:
  ```python
  API_KEY = "your_api_key"
  SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
  ```

### **Edit the Strategy**
- Open `strategy.py` and replace the default logic with your own.
